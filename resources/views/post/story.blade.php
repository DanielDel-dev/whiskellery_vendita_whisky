                <h3>Etymology</h3>
                <p>The word whisky or whiskey is an anglicisation of the Classical Gaelic word uisce or uisge meaning "water" now written as uisce in Modern Irish, and uisge in Scottish Gaelic. This Gaelic word shares its ultimate origins with Germanic "water" and Slavic "voda" of the same meaning. Distilled alcohol was known in Latin as aqua vitae "water of life". This was translated into Old Irish as uisce beatha, which became uisce beatha in Irish and uisge beatha in Scottish Gaelic. Early forms of the word in English included uskebeaghe 1581, usquebaugh 1610, usquebath 1621, and usquebae 1715.</p>
                <h3 class="mt-4">History</h3>
                <p>It is possible that distillation was practised by the Babylonians in Mesopotamia in the 2nd millennium BC, with perfumes and aromatics being distilled, but this is subject to uncertain and disputed interpretations of evidence.</p>
                
                <p>The earliest certain chemical distillations were by Greeks in Alexandria in the 1st century AD, but these were not distillations of alcohol. The medieval Arabs adopted the distillation technique of the Alexandrian Greeks, and written records in Arabic begin in the 9th century, but again these were not distillations of alcohol. Distilling technology passed from the medieval Arabs to the medieval Latins, with the earliest records in Latin in the early 12th century.</p>
                
                <p>The earliest records of the distillation of alcohol are in Italy in the 13th century, where alcohol was distilled from wine. An early description of the technique was given by Ramon Llull. Its use spread through medieval monasteries, largely for medicinal purposes, such as the treatment of colic and smallpox.</p>

                <p>The art of distillation spread to Scotland and Ireland no later than the 15th century, as did the common European practice of distilling "aqua vitae", spirit alcohol, primarily for medicinal purposes. The practice of medicinal distillation eventually passed from a monastic setting to the secular via professional medical practitioners of the time, The Guild of Barber Surgeons. The earliest mention of whisky in Ireland comes from the seventeenth-century Annals of Clonmacnoise, which attributes the death of a chieftain in 1405 to "taking a surfeit of aqua vitae" at Christmas. In Scotland, the first evidence of whisky production comes from an entry in the Exchequer Rolls for 1494 where malt is sent "To Friar John Cor, by order of the king, to make aquavitae", enough to make about 500 bottles.</p> 
                
                <p>James IV of Scotland (r. 1488–1513) reportedly had a great liking for Scotch whisky, and in 1506 the town of Dundee purchased a large amount of whisky from the Guild of Barber-Surgeons, which held the monopoly on production at the time. Between 1536 and 1541, King Henry VIII of England dissolved the monasteries, sending their monks out into the general public. Whisky production moved out of a monastic setting and into personal homes and farms as newly independent monks needed to find a way to earn money for themselves.</p> 
                
                
                <p>Old Bushmills Distillery, County Antrim
                The distillation process was still in its infancy; whisky itself was not allowed to age, and as a result tasted very raw and brutal compared totoday's versions. Renaissance-era whisky was also very potent and not diluted. Over time whisky evolved into a much smoother drink.
                
                With a licence to distil Irish whiskey from 1608, the Old Bushmills Distillery in Northern Ireland is the oldest licensed whiskey distillery in theworld.
                
                In 1707, the Acts of Union merged England and Scotland, and thereafter taxes on it rose dramatically.</p> 
                
                <h3 class="my-4">Production</h3>
                <h5 class="font-weight-bold">Distillation</h5>
                <p>A still for making whisky is usually made of copper, since it removes sulfur-based compounds from the alcohol that would make it unpleasant todrink. Modern stills are made of stainless steel with copper innards (piping, for example, will be lined with copper along with copper plate inlaysalong still walls). The simplest standard distillation apparatus is commonly known as a pot still, consisting of a single heated chamber and avessel to collect purified alcohol.
                        
                Column stills are frequently used in the production of grain whisky and are the most commonly used type of still in the production of bourboand other American whiskeys. Column stills behave like a series of single pot stills, formed in a long vertical tube. Whereas a single pot stilcharged with wine might yield a vapour enriched to 40–60% alcohol, a column still can achieve a vapour alcohol content of 95.6%; an azeotropimixture of alcohol and water.</p>
                
                <h5 class="font-weight-bold">Aging</h5> 
                <p>Whiskies do not mature in the bottle, only in the cask, so the "age" of a whisky is only the time between distillation and bottling. Thireflects how much the cask has interacted with the whisky, changing its chemical makeup and taste. Whiskies that have been bottled for manyears may have a rarity value, but are not "older" and not necessarily "better" than a more recent whisky that matured in wood for a similatime. After a decade or two, additional aging in a barrel does not necessarily improve a whisky.
                            
                While aging in wooden casks, especially American oak and French oak casks, whisky undergoes six processes that contribute to its finflavour: extraction, evaporation, oxidation, concentration, filtration, and colouration. Extraction in particular results in whisacquiring a number of compounds, including aldehydes and acids such as vanillin, vanillic acid, and syringaldehyde. Distillers wisometimes age their whiskey in barrels previously used to age other spirits, such as rum or sherry, to impart particular flavours.</p>
                
                <h5 class="font-weight-bold">Packaging</h5>
                <p>Most whiskies are sold at or near an alcoholic strength of 40% abv, which is the statutory minimum in some countries – although tstrength can vary, and cask-strength whisky may have as much as twice that alcohol percentage.</p>
                
                <h5 class="font-weight-bold">Exports</h5>
                <p>Whisky is probably the best known of Scotland's manufactured products. Exports have increased by 87% in the decade to 2012 and contributes over £4.25 billion to the UK economy, making up a quarter of all its food and drink revenues. In 2012, the US was the largemarket for Scotch whisky (£655 million), followed by France (£535 million). It is also one of the UK's overall top five manufacturing expoearners and it supports around 35,000 jobs. Principal whisky producing areas include Speyside and the Isle of Islay, where there are nidistilleries providing a major source of employment. In many places, the industry is closely linked to tourism, with many distilleries alfunctioning as attractions worth £30 million GVA each year.
                                
                In 2011, 70% of Canadian whisky was exported, with about 60% going to the US, and the rest mostly to Europe and Asia. 15 million caof Canadian whisky were sold in the US in 2011.</p>
